  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Editing Code</span></h1>
  <p>The Text Editor will open when you create an asset that requires it (e.g. Objects, Scripts, Shaders, etc.).</p>
  <p>As described on <a href="../The_Text_Editor.htm">The Text Editor</a>, some asset types contain <strong>documents</strong> within them. For example, Objects have <strong>events</strong>, Timelines have <strong>moments</strong>, and Shaders have <strong>fragment</strong> and <strong>vertex </strong>shaders, which are separate documents within the asset.</p>
  <p>For Objects and Timelines, since they won&#39;t have any documents to begin with, you will see this:</p>
  <p data-condition="Misc:Need_change">IMAGE - CREATE CTA</p>
  <p>You can click on the &quot;<strong>Create ...</strong>&quot; button to create your first document (in this example, clicking on this would open the <strong>Events</strong> menu as it is an object).</p>
  <h2>Editing GML</h2>
  <p>The Text Editor will display either <a href="../../GameMaker_Language.htm">GML</a> Code or GML Visual depending on the type of event or script that is open.</p>
  <p data-condition="Misc:Need_change">IMAGE - GML Code and GML Visual, with button to switch</p>
  <p>You can change the type of event/script from the bottom-right corner of the Editor Frame.</p>
  <p>The rest of this document will cover editing text-based documents, i.e. anything that is not GML Visual.</p>
  <h2>Document Headers</h2>
  <p>By default, the editor will display all documents for the current asset at the same time, one after another. This can be disabled in the <a data-xref="{title}" href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Text_Editor_2_Preferences.htm">Text Editor 2 Preferences</a>.</p>
  <p>For example, all events for an Object or both Shader files are displayed at once:</p>
  <p data-condition="Misc:Need_change">IMAGE - Object Events and Shader Files</p>
  <p>Each document begins with a &quot;header&quot;, e.g. where it says &quot;Create&quot; before the contents of the Create event above. You can press  <img class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Fold.png" />  next to it in the gutter (on the left hand side) to collapse that document.</p>
  <p>When scrolling down into a document, its header will stick to the top so you can see the name of the document. This can be disabled from the Preferences.</p>
  <p>You can also enable sticky Statement Headers, so the initial lines for foldable regions stick to the top while they&#39;re visible.</p>
  <h3>Context Menu</h3>
  <p>You can right-click on a Document Header for options which are specific to the opened asset. For example, you see this for objects:</p>
  <p data-condition="Misc:Need_change">IMAGE - Object Event RMB menu</p>
  <p>For information on these options, see <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Object_Properties/Object_Events.htm">Object Events</a>.</p>
  <h3>Parent View</h3>
  <p>For Objects, parent events will be displayed in child objects but will be greyed out unless they are overridden/inherited.</p>
  <p data-condition="Misc:Need_change">IMAGE - Parent event and parent menu</p>
  <p>The document header for such events will display a menu, where you can choose to inherit or override an event. For more information, see <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Object_Properties/Parent_Objects.htm">Parent Objects</a>.</p>
  <h3>Navigation Between Documents</h3>
  <p>When all documents are displayed in the same editor, they practically function as if they are one document.</p>
  <p>For example, you can have your text cursor at the last line of your event, and press the <strong>down arrow key</strong> to move to the first line of the next event document.</p>
  <p>There are some handy shortcuts for document navigation:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>ALT/OPT + UP/DOWN</strong>: Go to the previous (up) or next (down) document. Text cursor position is preserved from when you last left a document.</li>
    <li><strong>ALT/OPT + SHIFT + M</strong>: Fold all documents. Useful for navigating between events if you have a lot of them.</li>
    <li><strong>ALT/OPT + SHIFT + U</strong>: Unfold all documents.</li>
    <li><strong>ALT/OPT + M</strong>: Fold the currently active document (the one where your text cursor is present).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Writing Code</h2>
  <p>While writing code you will get syntax highlighting and auto-complete for the language you are currently editing. You can read about this in-depth on <a data-xref="{title}" href="Language_And_Themes.htm">Language And Themes</a>.</p>
  <p data-condition="Misc:Need_change">IMAGE - Auto completion</p>
  <p>This window will pop up while you are writing your code (normally after a slight pause, but this can be set in the <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Text_Editor_2_Preferences.htm">Preferences</a>) and give you a selection of &quot;best-fit&quot; answers in alphabetical order.</p>
  <p>For other features when editing GML Code, see <a data-xref="{title}" href="Feather_Features.htm">Feather Features</a>.</p>
  <p>Documents can also have JSDoc style comments define the properties of the functions they contain, so when you use the functions in your code they show up in auto-complete along with their arguments and other details. You can find out more about this from the section <a href="JSDoc_Script_Comments.htm">JSDoc Script Comments</a> for more information.</p>
  <h2>Code Folding</h2>
  <p>For GML documents, the following parts are foldable:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li>Function declarations</li>
    <li>if, else, for, while, repeat, do, with, switch, case, default
      <ul>
        <li>Folding for these is only provided if the body is surrounded in <span class="inline2">{}</span> brackets (multi-line)</li>
        <li>The exception to this are switch statements and their cases, which do not require brackets for folding</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Any <span class="inline2">{}</span> brackets, <span class="inline2">begin ... end</span></li>
    <li>Multi-line comments (<span class="inline2">/* ... */</span>)</li>
    <li>Regions (<span class="inline2">#region ... #endregion</span>)</li>
  </ul>
